##Inspiration
We wanted to make a game bringing attention to the problem of pollution in Canada. Pollution is a cause for concern not only in Canada but in all of the world, and while our game keeps a mostly light-hearted tone throughout, we still believed it important to bring attention to the issue of pollution through our setting and main objective.

##What it does
BennyBeaver2010 is a type racing game, built in Processing, and utilizes visual assets constructed by the group members. Help Benny by typing the words displayed on the garbage, destroying them in the process and buying him time to repair/reconstruct his dam.

##How we built it
We used Processing, a powerful, specialized, easy-to-read language to build our game. Visual Studio Live Share was used to synchronously write code, and GitHub was used to organize our project into one place. We also used Paint3D, GIMP, Pixel it, Piskel, and UnScreen to produce our visual assets. The sound files were obtained from websites under the creative commons license. References for all assets can be found in our GitHub repository.

##Challenges we ran into
None of us had any experience using processing, so it was difficult for us to both learn and then apply our knowledge towards a practical application. We also had no experience with the video game development workflow, so we had to figure out the most efficient way to design our project. Lastly, our experience in developing our own assets was minimal, so we had to figure out tools to create the assets we wanted.

##Accomplishments that we're proud of
We finished the project in time!!!

##What we learned
We learned how to use the programming language Processing, how teams go about developing games, and how to develop your own assets for the purposes of a video game.

##What's next for BennyBeaver2010
We would like to eventually implement an endless mode for the game.
